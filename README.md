# 9. Deployment:
  * Choose a hosting provider and deploy your application.
  * Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
# 10.Image and Video Storage with AWS S3:
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a highly scalable object storage service offered by AWS. Here's how you can use S3 for storing images and videos:
Create an S3 Bucket: Log in to the AWS Management Console, navigate to the S3 service, and create a new bucket. This bucket will serve as the storage location for your images and videos.
Set Up Permissions: Configure access control policies for your S3 bucket to control who can upload, download, and manage objects stored in the bucket. You can use IAM policies to define permissions for specific users or roles.
Upload Images and Videos: Use the AWS SDK or AWS Management Console to upload images and videos to your S3 bucket. You can also configure lifecycle policies to automatically move or delete objects based on predefined rules.
# 11. Hosting the Project with AWS Lambda and API Gateway:
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can use Lambda to execute backend logic for your application. Here's how you can host your project using Lambda and API Gateway:
Deploy Backend Code to Lambda: Package your Node.js/Express.js backend code into a deployment package and upload it to AWS Lambda. You can define Lambda functions to handle different API endpoints or business logic.
Set Up API Gateway: Create an API using Amazon API Gateway to expose your Lambda functions as HTTP endpoints. API Gateway acts as a proxy between your frontend and backend, allowing you to define RESTful APIs and manage requests/responses.
Configure CORS: Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on your API Gateway to allow your frontend application hosted elsewhere to make requests to your API.
Integrate Frontend with Backend: Update your frontend code to make API requests to the endpoints exposed by API Gateway. You'll need to handle authentication, request validation, and response parsing in your frontend code.
